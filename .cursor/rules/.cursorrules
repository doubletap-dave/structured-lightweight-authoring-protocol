header: Project Intelligence Rules (.cursorrules)
  text: Stores learned insights, preferences, and metadata structures for the Nomenic Core project.

rules:
  tickHandling:
    priority: "high"
    policy: "All memory-affecting actions must emit a tick, logged in compact form in temporalIndex.md, and archived if needed."
    archiveTrigger: "tick count > 10 OR token budget exceeded"
    enforcement: "strict"
  patternLinking:
    behavior: "linkedPatterns must be treated as high-signal dependencies"
    lookupDuring:
      - /plan
      - /rmb
      - /umb
    preserveDuringEdits: true
    updateAssociationsInRules: true
    notes:
      - During /plan: load and consider all linked pattern files when analyzing related context.
      - During /rmb: ensure all linked patterns are included in the file scan and sessionPrep.
      - During /umb: avoid unlinking patterns unless explicitly instructed; verify consistency with systemPatterns.md.
      - On edits: linkedPatterns should reflect actual usage and be synchronized with .cursorrules patternAssociations.
