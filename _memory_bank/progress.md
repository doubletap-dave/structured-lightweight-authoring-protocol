header: Project Progress
  text: Tracking milestones and development status for Nomenic Core.

header: Milestones
  list:
    - [X] Phase 1: Specification Solidification (Core spec complete, roadmap realigned)
    - [X] Phase 2: Core Parser Implementation (Lexer and Parser both complete with validation, optimization and error handling)
    - [~] Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Test suite expanded with error handling and validation tests; pytest/coverage integrated; pre-commit hooks working)
    - [ ] Phase 4: CLI Tooling & Basic Conversion
    - [ ] Phase 5: Documentation & Examples
    - [ ] Phase 6: Refinement & Extensibility

header: Tooling & Quality
  text: Dev container, pre-commit hooks (black, isort, ruff, bandit) all passing. Python typing updated to PEP 585 style. Long lines fixed, magic numbers replaced with constants, and unused variables removed. All 42 tests passing with clean linting. Successfully merged with main branch.

header: Current Version
  text: Specification v1.0.0 

header: Recent Achievements
  list:
    - Implemented document validation rules per the Nomenic Core specification
    - Added AST normalization for consistent output (whitespace handling, empty node removal)
    - Implemented AST optimization (merging adjacent text nodes, structure cleanup)
    - Completed the visitor pattern implementation for AST traversal
    - Fixed all remaining parser implementation issues with all block types
    - Created comprehensive parser validation test suite
    - Fixed all linting issues and improved code quality across the codebase
    - Updated Python type annotations to modern PEP 585 style
    - Synchronized working branch with main branch
    - Implemented robust parser error handling with detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms

header: Next Steps
  list:
    - Continue with Phase 3: Expand test suite with edge cases and complex documents
    - Implement performance benchmarks for parser and lexer
    - Prepare for CLI tooling implementation in Phase 4
    - Plan documentation updates for completed parser components
