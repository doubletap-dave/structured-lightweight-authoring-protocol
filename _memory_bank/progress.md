header: Milestones
  list:
    - [X] Phase 1: Specification Solidification (Core spec complete, roadmap realigned)
    - [~] Phase 2: Core Parser Implementation (Lexer complete; Parser partially implemented with robust error handling)
    - [~] Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Test suite expanded with error handling tests; pytest/coverage integrated; pre-commit hooks working)
