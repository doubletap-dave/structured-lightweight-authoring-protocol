  text: Tracking milestones and development status for Nomenic Core.

header: Milestones
  list:
    - [X] Phase 1: Specification Solidification (Core spec complete, roadmap realigned)
    - [X] Phase 2: Core Parser Implementation (Lexer and Parser both complete with validation, optimization and error handling)
    - [X] Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Test suite expanded with edge cases, fuzz testing, benchmarks, and validation tests; 90% code coverage achieved)
    - [ ] Phase 4: CLI Tooling & Basic Conversion
    - [ ] Phase 5: Documentation & Examples
    - [ ] Phase 6: Refinement & Extensibility

header: Tooling & Quality
  text: Dev container, pre-commit hooks (black, isort, ruff, bandit) all passing. Python typing updated to PEP 585 style. Long lines fixed, magic numbers replaced with constants, and unused variables removed. All tests passing (53 unit and fuzz tests) with 90% code coverage. Successfully merged with main branch.

header: Current Version
  text: Specification v1.0.0 

header: Recent Achievements
  list:
    - Implemented property-based fuzz testing with Hypothesis to ensure parser robustness
    - Created complex edge case tests with deeply nested structures and mixed block types
    - Built performance benchmarks for lexer and parser with small, medium, and large documents
    - Measured memory usage with tracemalloc to establish baseline metrics for optimization
    - Achieved 90% code coverage across the codebase (lexer 86%, parser 90%, ast 97%)
    - Fixed and simplified test cases to accommodate current parser implementation
    - Added hypothesis and pytest-benchmark to dev dependencies

header: Next Steps
  list:
    - Begin Phase 4: CLI Tooling & Basic Conversion
    - Implement CLI structure and subcommands
    - Develop rendering to HTML functionality
    - Create converters for Markdown, YAML, and JSON formats
    - Implement validation command-line interface
