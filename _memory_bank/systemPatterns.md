# System Patterns

## Overview
This document captures the key architectural and implementation patterns used in the Nomenic Core project. These patterns represent solutions to recurring problems and serve as guidance for maintaining consistency across the codebase.

## Core Patterns

### 1. nomenic-core-development
**Description**: The main development workflow for Nomenic Core, including branching strategy, code review process, and integration testing approach.

**Key Components**:
- Feature branch workflow (feature → develop → main)
- Required code review by at least one team member
- CI/CD pipeline for automatic testing
- Semantic versioning for releases

**Implementation Example**:
```python
# Branch naming convention
# feature/short-description-of-feature
# bugfix/issue-reference-and-description
# release/vX.Y.Z
```

**Usage**: Applied to all development work in the Nomenic Core repository.

### 2. python-testing
**Description**: Comprehensive testing strategy for Python components using pytest.

**Key Components**:
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Coverage reporting with minimum 80% threshold
- Parametrized tests for edge cases

**Implementation Example**:
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_text,expected", [
    ("simple command", ParseResult(command="simple", args=[])),
    ("complex command with args", ParseResult(command="complex", args=["with", "args"])),
])
def test_parser(input_text, expected):
    result = parser.parse(input_text)
    assert result == expected
```

**Usage**: Applied to all Python modules in the codebase.

### 3. validation-pipelines
**Description**: Automated validation workflows and quality assurance processes
that ensure code, data, and configuration consistency. Includes 
static analysis, runtime verification, and performance benchmarking.

**Key Components**:
- Static analysis tools (pylint, mypy, black)
- Unit and integration test frameworks
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Runtime behavior validation
- Data schema verification

**Implementation Example**:
```yaml
# CI Pipeline Configuration
validation:
  stages:
    - lint
    - type-check
    - test
    - benchmark
    - security-scan
  
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
```

**Usage**: Applied to all pull requests and merges to main development branches.

header: Core Design Patterns
  list:
    - **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential lexer → parser → processor → renderer pipeline.
    - **Token Stream**: Unified token representation independent of source format.
    - **Visitor Pattern**: Traversing AST nodes for transformations and rendering.
    - **Factory Methods**: Standardized node creation/instantiation.
    - **Observer Pattern**: Notification of state changes during parsing.

header: Error Handling Patterns
  list:
    - **Dual Error Modes**: Both recording (non-fatal) and reporting (exception-raising) modes.
    - **Error Context Capture**: Storing token positions and context with each error.
    - **Synchronization Points**: Defining statement boundaries for error recovery.
    - **Progressive Degradation**: Continuing to parse as much as possible despite errors.
    - **Category-Based Organization**: Grouping errors by type (syntax, semantic, etc.)
    - **Diagnostic Tooling**: Purpose-built tools for error analysis.
    - **Test-First Validation**: Comprehensive test suite for error scenarios.

  description: Base syntax rules and conventions for Nomenic Core documents
  status: stable
  version: 1.0.0
  components:
    - Line-oriented structure with explicit tokens
    - Indentation-based nesting (2 spaces)
    - Block-level elements with clear delimiters
    - Inline annotations for metadata
