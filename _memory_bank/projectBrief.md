header: Project Brief: Nomenic Core
  text: Nomenic Core is a structured authoring format designed for clarity, AI efficiency, and machine-readable precision. It aims to be a token-efficient and extensible alternative to formats like Markdown, YAML, and XML, unifying human-readable documentation and machine-consumable data structure.
  text: Key goals include minimal syntax, high readability, efficient token usage for LLMs/parsers, clear structure, and extensibility.

header: Core Problem Solved
  text: Addresses the difficulty of maintaining documentation that is both easily readable by humans and efficiently processable by machines. Aims to replace "markdown spaghetti" and other less structured or overly verbose formats.
