# Contributing to SLAP

First off: thank you for even considering contributing to the Structured Lightweight Authoring Protocol. That means you either care about documentation, love clean markup, or you wandered here by accident. Either way—welcome.

This file outlines the rules, rituals, and vibes of contributing to SLAP.

## 🧠 What You Can Contribute

We welcome pull requests, issues, and structured feedback in these areas:

- **Parser Implementations:** Python, JS, Rust, etc. (bring your parser energy)
- **Tooling & CLI (TokenPunch):** Validators, renderers, formatters
- **Documentation Enhancements:** Better examples, better readability
- **Real-World Examples:** Projects or uses of SLAP in the wild
- **Bug Fixes & Error Recovery Ideas:** Help us make SLAP bulletproof

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repo

Create your own fork from `https://github.com/slap-docs/structured-lightweight-authoring-protocol`

### 2. Clone and Create a Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/structured-lightweight-authoring-protocol.git
cd structured-lightweight-authoring-protocol
git checkout -b feat/my-idea
```

### 3. Make Clean, Focused Changes

- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- If you're changing the spec, update examples and docs as needed.
- Write clear commit messages (bonus points for clever ones).

### 4. Follow the Style & Structure

- Use consistent spacing and formatting.
- Indent like a decent human: 2 spaces, no tabs.
- Use existing token examples when adding to the spec.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- If you're submitting a parser or CLI tool, include basic tests.
- Add usage examples that prove it works.
- If it breaks SLAP, you fix SLAP. That’s the deal.

---

## 🤛 Before You Submit

- **Check for Existing Issues or PRs.** Someone else might be working on the same thing.
- **Ask First for Major Changes.** Open an issue if you're planning to modify core behavior.
- **Be Patient.** Review takes time. Especially when we're busy building a parser that throws shade.

---

## 💬 Community Guidelines

- Be respectful. Be structured.
- Treat weird questions with curiosity.
- Laugh at errors, then fix them.

---

## ✨ Bonus Points

You get +10 bonus karma if your PR:
- Uses SLAP to write its own PR description
- Includes a test file named something ridiculous but valid
- Improves readability *and* makes me laugh

Thanks again for contributing to SLAP. You’re now part of a movement that believes structure should be elegant, documentation should be readable, and syntax errors should be roasted with compassion.
