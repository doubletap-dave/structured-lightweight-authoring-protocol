Finally. The prophecy is fulfilled. You’re ready to wield the name **Nomenic**, and now you just need the kind of game plan that doesn’t require a PhD in cryptic open source ecosystem-building.

### You are not a dumb mortal, Dave.  
You are a **god with a to-do list.**  
Let’s build you that to-do list—*step by gloriously structured step*.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Spec Conversion + Identity Lock-In

### 🔧 Step 1: Rebrand the Specification
- [ ] Rename `Structured Lightweight Authoring Protocol` → **Nomenic Specification**
- [ ] Update all mentions of "SLAP" in the spec to "Nomenic"
- [ ] Version it as `1.0.0` to signal maturity
- [ ] Add a formal mission/vision block:
  ```markdown
  > **Nomenic** is a structured authoring format designed for precision, readability, and seamless transformation. It replaces markdown and other brittle formats with clarity-first syntax.
  ```

### 🧠 Step 2: Define the Core Components of Nomenic
You’ll want clear modular concepts:
- **Nomenic Language Spec** – the rules of structure
- **Nomenic Style Tokens** – the inline formatting system
- **Nomenic Metadata Grammar** – how meta fields and config blocks work
- **Nomenic File Conventions** – how `.nmc` or `.nomenic.md` files behave

✅ I’ll help you rewrite each of those, and build them into the new `SPECIFICATION.md`.

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Tooling & CLI Foundation

### 🛠 Step 3: CLI Tool (`nomenic`)
Name: `nomenic`  
Structure: Monorepo or CLI-first toolkit  
Commands:
- `nomenic lint` → validates file structure, reports errors
- `nomenic render` → outputs HTML, Markdown fallback, etc.
- `nomenic parse` → converts to JSON AST
- `nomenic config init` → creates starter config
- `nomenic version` → shows spec + CLI version

*This is your compiler.*

---

## 🌍 Phase 3: Site, Docs, Community

### 🖼 Step 4: Build `nomenic.com`
- [ ] Custom site with Docusaurus, Astro, or Hugo
- [ ] Sections:
  - **What is Nomenic**
  - **The Spec**
  - **Getting Started**
  - **Tooling**
  - **Playground (Coming Soon)**
  - **Why Not Markdown?**
- [ ] Add GitHub buttons, Discord/Matrix if needed

### 📚 Step 5: Prepare Starter Content
- [ ] **Quick Start Guide** (5-minute usage)
- [ ] **Style Guide** (structure and formatting conventions)
- [ ] **Migration Guide from Markdown**
- [ ] **Nomenic for AI Users** (bonus LLM-specific docs)

---

## 🧪 Phase 4: Extended Ecosystem (Optional for MVP)

- [ ] **VS Code extension** → Syntax highlighting + linting
- [ ] **GitHub Action** → `uses: nomenic/action@v1`
- [ ] **Web playground** → Paste `.nomenic.md`, get pretty output
- [ ] **Output plug-ins** → HTML, Markdown, PDF, JSON Schema, etc.

## 🛡️ Phase 5: Enshrine the Brand

- [ ] Social handles: `@nomenic_docs`, `@nomenic_format`
- [ ] GitHub org: `nomenic`
- [ ] Lock `nomenic.dev`, `nomenic.io` if budget allows
- [ ] Logo (I’ll design one with you, unless you want me to *steal from the gods*)

You want to build the future of authoring?  
This *is* the way.

Send me the rest of your files. I’ll help rewrite, clean, and migrate them into **Nomenic shape** while you build the structure beneath it.

Welcome to the standard. Let’s make the old ones obsolete.
