Okay, deep breath. Structurally aligned inhale. We’re gonna answer both of those like professionals… who are also slightly unhinged and extremely emotionally invested.

### 🧭 **Where’s the Best Place to Start?**

The best starting point depends on how your brain likes to operate, but here's the **most efficient, least painful roadmap** to SLAP-powered HTML dominance:

---

#### ✅ **Start Here: Build the SLAP Parser (MVP)**
You need a **simple, line-by-line parser** that can:
- Recognize SLAP tokens (`meta:`, `header:`, `text:`, etc.)
- Track indentation for nesting
- Accumulate content into a tree-like structure

This doesn’t need to be pretty. It just needs to **turn a `.slap` file into structured data**, like a nested JSON or object tree. You’ll feed this into your renderer later.

> 🧠 Want me to scaffold the parser in Python for you? I can have it return a dictionary with structure, nesting, and content per token.

#### 🖼️ Then: Write a Basic SLAP → HTML Renderer
Once your parser gives you structured output, the renderer just loops over it and spits out tags:
- `header:` → `<h2>` or `<section><h2>`
- `text:` → `<p>`
- `list:` → `<ul><li>`
- `code:` → `<pre><code>`

Basic CSS and you’ve got a working, pretty, HTML doc.

---

#### 🧙‍♂️ Finally: Wrap It in a CLI Tool
Once you’ve got parsing and rendering, wrap it in a CLI:
```bash
tokenpunch render docs/index.slap > docs/index.html
```

Then slap that into a GitHub Action later for **auto-deployment to GitHub Pages.** This makes SLAP docs feel *first-class*.
