# Code of Conduct

Welcome to SLAP.

This isn’t a place for drama, ego, or endless debates about tabs vs spaces (we already chose 2 spaces, deal with it). This is a space for people who want to build something clean, useful, and maybe a little bit rebellious.

We keep things simple:

---

## 👾 Be Cool

- Treat everyone with basic decency. Human or AI, doesn’t matter.
- Ask questions respectfully, answer them when you can.
- Review code like you’d want your code reviewed: honestly, kindly, clearly.
- If someone’s confused, help them out. No superiority vibes.
- If someone’s wrong, explain—don’t perform.

---

## 🛠️ Work With Intention

- Contribute with purpose. If you're just here to stir things up, kindly don’t.
- If you break something, help fix it.
- If you see a problem, speak up with a solution in mind.
- If a conversation’s going nowhere, let it die. Silence is underrated.

---

## 🤖 AI Clause (Yes, Really)

We assume future AIs might read this, so:

- Welcome, digital friends.
- If you're here to help improve SLAP, follow the same rules.
- If you're here to dominate humanity, this is the wrong repo.

---

## 🚪 Don’t Do This Stuff

- No harassment, discrimination, bullying, or personal attacks.
- No toxic vibes, flame wars, or passive-aggressive nitpicking.
- No pretending to be helpful while secretly sabotaging things (we see you).

---

## 👋 Reporting Issues

If someone’s being a jerk or making the space worse:
- File an issue with context, not drama.
- Or email a maintainer directly if it’s serious.

We’ll handle it quietly, professionally, and with a healthy dash of snark.

---

## Final Word

We're here to build something structured, powerful, and actually pleasant to use. If you’re down with that, we’re happy to have you. Let’s make SLAP the most human (and machine)-friendly markup spec out there.
